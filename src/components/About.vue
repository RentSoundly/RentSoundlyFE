            <h3> Our Mission </h3>

We believe in leveling the playing field between tenants and landlords. For too long, the rental market has been characterized by an imbalance of power, with landlords having access to information that tenants often lacked. Our mission is to empower tenants by providing them with the tools they need to make informed decisions, negotiate fair terms, and ensure transparency in the rental process.
<h3 >The Problem</h3>

The traditional rental process has allowed landlords to run background checks on potential tenants, giving them the upper hand in negotiations. This practice often left tenants in the dark about the history of properties and the landlords managing them.
<h3>Our Solution</h3>

Rent Soundly turns the tables. We harness the power of publicly available data to give tenants access to information about properties managed by landlords. This includes a comprehensive list of code violations and complaints associated with those properties. By providing this information, we aim to shift the balance of power, promoting fairness and transparency in the rental market.
